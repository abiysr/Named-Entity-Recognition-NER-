# Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-
Named Entity Recognition is a sub-task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and categorizing key pieces of information (called "named entities") in a text.
These entities can be names of people, organizations, locations, dates, monetary values, percentages, and more.
Example:
In the sentence:
"Apple, based in Cupertino, announced that Tim Cook will be presenting the new iPhone in September for $999."
An NER system would identify:
•	Apple: Organization (ORG)
•	Cupertino: Location (GPE - Geopolitical Entity)
•	Tim Cook: Person (PERSON)
•	September: Date (DATE)
•	$999: Money (MONEY)
Popular Python Libraries for NER
We will explore three main libraries, each with its own strengths:
1.	spaCy: The most popular choice for production environments. It's fast, efficient, highly accurate, and very easy to use. (Recommended for most users).
2.	NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): The classic NLP library, great for learning the fundamental building blocks of NLP.
3.	Hugging Face Transformers: Provides state-of-the-art, pre-trained models (like BERT) for maximum accuracy, though it can be more resource-intensive.

Which Library Should You Use?
•	For Beginners & Production: Use spaCy. It provides the best balance of ease of use, speed, and accuracy for most common tasks.
•	For Academic Learning: Use NLTK. It's great for understanding the fundamental steps of an NLP pipeline.
•	For State-of-the-Art Accuracy: Use Hugging Face Transformers. When you need the absolute highest accuracy for research or a critical application, and you can handle the larger model sizes and slower processing.
